README

This is an Open Wonderland module; a piece of code that extends the functionality
of the Open Wonderland Virtual Worlds Toolkit (http://openwonderland.org)

This code was written for the tutorial that can be read at:
http://faithhold.dyndns.org:8080/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Sample%20HUD%20Tutorial

The code creates a HUD (heads up display) showing a simple JButton, that can be
activated/deactivated by the user.

How to use this module

Simple use 'ant deploy' from command line.
To use the tutorial make sure you modify my.module.properties to reflect your
local Open Wodnderland installation.
